= Instiki

Instiki is a wiki clone so pretty and easy to set up, you'll wonder if itâ€™s really a wiki. Runs on Rails and focuses on portability and stability. Supports file uploads, PDF export, RSS, multiple users and password protection. Some use Instiki as a CMS (Content Management System) because of its ability to export static pages.

Instiki lowers the barriers of interest for when you might consider using a wiki. It's so simple to get running that you'll find yourself using it for anything -- taking notes, brainstorming, organizing a gathering.


== Supported Platforms

This fork is designed for deploying instiki to Heroku. I recommend using the
real release version if you wish to run it anywhere else. Download the source at
http://instiki.org/

Note for Heroku read-only filesystem: file uploads are disabled by default.

== 5 easy Steps to get the Instiki on Heroku experience

#!/bin/bash
git clone git://github.com/lazzarello/instiki-heroku.git
cd instiki-heroku
heroku create
git push heroku master
heroku rake db:migrate

=== If you are on Linux

You are already rad, you got this. Follow the 5 step program

=== If you are on Mac OSX

Install git and heroku and follow the 5 step program.

=== If you are on Windows

You may be screwed, but I don't know because I recommend running Debian
GNU/Linux for everything except for entertaining yourself, for that I recommend
MacOS X.

=== Backing up on Heroku.
